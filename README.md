### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want continue focusing on my layout and responsive web design skills. I feel like I have a good grasp on the basics but I want to continue to improve my skills. Also keen to continue learning Tailwind CSS and delve more into React.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for getting a better understanding around flex. I really liked this article and the visuals and will use it going forward.
- [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand grid more clearly. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept or just as a refresher.
